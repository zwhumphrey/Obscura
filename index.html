        <p> There are literally dozens of sites comparing flight and hotel prices. Obscura was designed not to compete with these sites, but rather, compliment. Whether your traveling for business or pleasure, most everyone remembers to book their hotel. It's the little things we forget: an umbrella for a rainy day, a swimsuit for the beach, or local currency for that hole in the wall restaurant everyone in town raves about. Obscura's got you covered. We'll help make sure you <a href="https://www.smartertravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Ultimate-Packing-List_Interactive-FINAL.pdf"> don't forget anything</a>
